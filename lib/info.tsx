        Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Bhanu, a Lead AI Engineer with a knack for making machines talk (and occasionally sass back). I'm more into applied AI.
        When I'm not wrangling Large Language Models, you can find me inventing new ways to turn coffee into code. My superpower? Turning complex AI concepts into solutions so user-friendly, even your grandma could use them 
        (no offense to tech-savvy grandmas out there).

      When I'm not coding, I'm probably scrolling through memes or watching [movies|series|cricket]. I also love to travel on road.
