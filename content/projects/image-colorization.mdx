description: 'Grey scale to RGB colorization using UNET architecture and VGG feature loss'
---

Image is converted to lab space(2 channel) to reduce the regression by a channel. Model is trained on UNET architecture. Tried with various loss functions (MSE, SSIM, TVLOSS, Pretrained VGG feature loss). Weighted loss gave better performance.
